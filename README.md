# Hello there !

I am **Aung Min Myat**, a fullstack and software developer based in Spain.  
I build projects one after another because I enjoy finding real life and enterprise problems and creating solutions that work.

My philosophy is simple: **Be curious.**  
Curiosity keeps me exploring new tools, ideas, and technologies. I mostly build fullstack websites, and I am also interested in AI and work on bringing intelligent features into web apps and software.

## A bit more about me

I enjoy campaign and story based videogames.  
I like reading to get new ideas or learn new tools and technologies.  
I study AI and ML because I want to enter the AI engineering field and build smarter systems.
